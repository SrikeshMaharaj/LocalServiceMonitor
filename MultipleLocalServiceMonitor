#Modified version that allows you to monitor a specific service on "multiple" remote Windows servers:

# List of servers to check
$servers = "Server1", "Server2", "Server3"

# Name of the service to check
$serviceName = "Service Name"

foreach ($server in $servers) {
  # Check if the service is running on the current server
  $service = Get-Service -Name $serviceName -ComputerName $server
  if ($service.Status -ne "Running") {
    # Send email if the service is not running
    $to = "email@example.com"
    $subject = "'$serviceName' service stopped on $server"
    $body = "The '$serviceName' service has stopped on $server. Please start the service and investigate the issue."
    Send-MailMessage -To $to -Subject $subject -Body $body -SmtpServer "smtp.example.com"
  }
}
